# NSS - Network Security System

A system that uses non-ML AI to monitor and defend against unwanted and potentially threatening traffic.

Everything is modular and free to edit.


# FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!


## Need to do:
- Clean code and do something about the data structures
- Fix UI
- Fix Script not working in UI
- Fix Bandwidth test
- Fix logs not showing in Web-UI
- And more!! : _ :

## Personal:
- I have no idea about network security, this thing is 100% flawed, but I tried something left field. (You can say whatever you want man, taunting me for trying is a sign of weakness! :L)
- I havenâ€™t done vigorous testing; that is coming with more improvements.
- This is just a fun project for no reason but to learn.
- I plan on implementing this on a Raspberry Pi next to my hub ðŸ™‚

- **Flask - Web UI** - with various features and commands
- **Scapy - Packet capture**
