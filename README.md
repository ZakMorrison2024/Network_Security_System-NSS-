# NSS - Network Security System

A system that uses non-ML AI to monitor and defend against unwanted and potentially threatening traffic.

Everything is modular and free to edit.


# FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!


## Personal:
- I have no idea about network security, this thing is 100% flawed, but I tried something left field.
- I havenâ€™t done vigorous testing; that is coming with more improvements.
- This is just a fun project for no reason but to learn.
- I plan on implementing this on a Raspberry Pi next to my hub ðŸ™‚


## Features:
- **Flask - Web UI** - with various features and commands

### Pages:
- Admin_dash
- Base
- Controls
- Devices
- Index
- Login
- Network_traffic
- Message_admin
- Scan

- **Scapy - Packet capture**
- Packet Defence tactics against packets and malicious IPs
- Logging system for information

## Installation:
There is a small script at the first run that will install these packages automatically:

###Required packages 
    -'flask',  # Flask framework
